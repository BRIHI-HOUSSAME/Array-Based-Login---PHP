Security Considerations
Password Hashing: It's recommended to hash passwords before storing them. This project uses plain text passwords for simplicity. In a production environment, use PHP's password_hash() function.
SQL Injection: This project does not use a database, but if you integrate it with a database, ensure you use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Session Management: Ensure proper session management practices are followed to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.
Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities.
