# Array-Based Login System - PHP

## Introduction
This project is a simple login system implemented in PHP using an array-based approach for user authentication. It allows users to register, login, and logout using a username and password combination.

## Features
- User registration
- User login
- User logout
- Session management
- Basic error handling

## Requirements
- PHP 5.6 or higher
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Place the files in your web server's document root directory.
3. Ensure that PHP is installed and configured correctly on your server.
4. Set appropriate permissions for the project files if necessary.

## Usage
1. Open the project in your web browser.
2. Register a new account by providing a username and password.
3. Login using your registered credentials.
4. Once logged in, you can access the protected content.
5. Logout when done.

## Security Considerations
- **Password Hashing:** It's recommended to hash passwords before storing them. This project uses plain text passwords for simplicity. In a production environment, use PHP's `password_hash()` function.
- **SQL Injection:** This project does not use a database, but if you integrate it with a database, ensure you use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Session Management:** Ensure proper session management practices are followed to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities.
